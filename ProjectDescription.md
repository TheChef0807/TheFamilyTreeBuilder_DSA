# Family Tree Builder
- Implement a basic binary tree structure to represent family relationships.
- Allow users to add members and define parent-child relationships.
- Traverse and display the family tree in pre-order or in-order.


How It Works
1.	Add Family Members:
- Define a parent and their child. Specify whether the child is the left or right child.
- If the parent doesn't exist, it notifies the user.
- If a child slot (left/right) is already occupied, it notifies the user.
2.	Traversal:
- Pre-order Traversal: Visits the root, then left child, then right child.
- In-order Traversal: Visits the left child, then root, then right child.
3.	Menu Options:
- Add members, display the tree in two traversal orders, or exit the program.
